Using 30/70 test/train split(30% test and 70% train):
1) Implement a gradient descent algorithm that can do regression and predicts the price.
2) Report the mean squared error for train and test. 
3) Choose a threshold T and assume all the houses with a price larger than T are labeled as expensive and the rest are labeled as non-expensive. Implement a simple perceptron that can classify the houses as expensive/non-expensive for you. Report accuracy for train and test.
